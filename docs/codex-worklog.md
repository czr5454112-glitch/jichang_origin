# Codex Worklog

## 2026-06-16 18:00 - Phase0 and Phase1A startup

- Request: Complete the Python/C++ port prerequisites described in `czr005_project_master_plan.md`, starting with Phase0 and Phase1A.
- Branch: local startup work.
- Files changed: project metadata, docs skeletons, legacy parser modules, conversion scripts, parser tests.
- Commands run: legacy file inspection; parser count checks against `map2.txt` and `inputdata.txt`; conversion scripts; pytest; conda/cmake environment checks.
- Key observations: `map2.txt` has 54 nodes, 54 heuristic rows, and 69 directed edges. `inputdata.txt` has 28,506 raw tasks and expands to 43,603 Java-equivalent task legs under the early-bag split rule.
- Tests / validation: `python -m pytest` passed in scaffold and target; `C:\Users\38908\.conda\envs\czr005\python.exe -m pytest` passed in target.
- Safety / parity notes: this round does not change Java and does not introduce RL logic.
- Follow-up: full `environment.yml` creation timed out once during dependency solving/download, but the `czr005` env is registered and satisfies the Phase0 gates checked so far. Finish Python reference simulator, then C++ core parity and pybind boundary.
